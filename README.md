### Hello and welcome to my page! 👋

<!--
**prachisharma21/prachisharma21** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. Here are some ideas to get you started:-->
My name is Prachi Sharma, a theoretical physicist trained in quantum many-body physics. I also got an opportunity to do some projects using Density Functional theory during my postdoc. Currently, my research is based on error mitigation techniques for quantum algorithms via probabilistic methods. 

<!-- 👩‍🔬 Here is my professional website which is under construction- https://prachisharma21.github.io/ -->
- 🔭 I’m actively looking for jobs in the Quantum computing industry. 
- 💬 Ask me about condensed matter physics, many-body theory, quantum algorithms, noise modeling, DFT, etc.
